# Secure Text Editor

This windows forms application is designed as a secure text editor. It has authentication, meaning certain accounts can only view whilst others can edit rtf & txt files. This project was completed as part of my degree whilst studying Application Development With .NET.

## Technology

- C#
- Windows Forms
- Visual Studio

## Running Locally

You can either run the built executable, available in /bin/Debug/AppDevDotNetTask2.exe or open the whole solution in Visual Studio.
